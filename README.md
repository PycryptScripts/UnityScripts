# Overview

A maintained collection of useful & free unity scripts with detailed documentation that I've created to help get new Unity developers started on the right path to creating an awesome game while learning the different mechanics of these scripts!

If you feel I've missed something or want to suggest a script for me to create please contact me via Discord ```Pycrypt#5079``` and I'll get back to you ASAP.

# Scripts

## Character Controller
* [PlayerPlatformerController](https://github.com/PycryptScripts/UnityScripts/tree/master/PlayerController) - 2d platformer character controller

## Scene Transitioning
* [SceneTransition](https://github.com/PycryptScripts/UnityScripts/tree/master/SceneTransition) - Load new scene/previous scene

## Parallax Camera System
* [ParallaxCamera](https://github.com/PycryptScripts/UnityScripts/tree/master/ParallaxCamera) - Layered parallax camera

# Documentation
You can find all detailed documentation of a specific script in its respected parent folder. I've done this so the main README doesn't get over cluttered and confusing. ðŸ˜Ž
